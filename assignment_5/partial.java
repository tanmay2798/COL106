		//String str = "Aesop's Fables Translated by George Fyler Townsend  The Wolf and the Lamb  WOLF meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold resolved not tolay violent hands on him but to find some plea to justify to theLamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:Sirrah last year you grossly insulted me.  Indeed bleatedthe Lamb in a mournful tone of voice I was not then born.  Thensaid the Wolf You feed in my pasture.  No good sir repliedthe Lamb I have not yet tasted grass.  Again said the WolfYou drink of my well.  No exclaimed the Lamb I never yetdrank water for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drinkto me.  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up sayingWell! I won't remain supperless even though you refute everyone of my imputations.  The tyrant will always find a pretext forhis tyranny.The Bat and the Weasels  A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleadedto be spared his life.  The Weasel refused saying that he was bynature the enemy of all birds.  The Bat assured him that he wasnot a bird but a mouse and thus was set free.  Shortlyafterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught byanother Weasel whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.  TheWeasel said that he had a special hostility to mice.  The Batassured him that he was not a mouse but a bat and thus a secondtime escaped.   It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.   The Ass and the Grasshopper  AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping was highlyenchanted; and desiring to possess the same charms of melodydemanded what sort of food they lived on to give them suchbeautiful voices.  They replied The dew.  The Ass resolved thathe would live only upon dew and in a short time died of hunger.  The Lion and the Mouse  A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising up angrily he caught him and was about to kill him whenthe Mouse piteously entreated saying:  If you would only sparemy life I would be sure to repay your kindness.  The Lionlaughed and let him go.  It happened shortly after this that theLion was caught by some hunters who bound him by st ropes to theground.  The Mouse recognizing his roar came gnawed the ropewith his teeth and set him free exclaim  You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help youexpecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I nowyou know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits ona Lion.   The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller  A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house.  One dayhe met a friend a Fuller and entreated him to come and livewith him saying that they should be far better neighbors andthat their housekeeping expenses would be lessened.  The Fullerreplied The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concernedfor whatever I should whiten you would immediately blacken againwith your charcoal.   Like will draw like.   The Father and His Sons  A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarrelingamong themselves.  When he failed to heal their disputes by hisexhortations he determined to give them a practical illustrationof the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day toldthem to bring him a bundle of sticks.  When they had done so heplaced the faggot into the hands of each of them in successionand ordered them to break it in pieces.  They tried with alltheir strength and were not able to do it.  He next opened thefaggot took the sticks separately one by one and again putthem into his sons' hands upon which they broke them easily.  Hethen addressed them in these words:  My sons if you are of onemind and unite to assist each other you will be as this faggotuninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you aredivided among yourselves you will be broken as easily as thesesticks.   The Boy Hunting Locusts  A BOY was hunting for locusts.  He had caught a goodly numberwhen he saw a Scorpion and mistaking him for a locust reachedout his hand to take him.  The Scorpion showing his sting said:If you had but touched me my friend you would have lost me andall your locusts too!   The Cock and the Jewel  A COCK scratching for food for himself and his hens found aprecious stone and exclaimed:  If your owner had found thee andnot I he would have taken thee up and have set thee in thyfirst estate; but I have found thee for no purpose.  I wouldrather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.   The Kingdom of the Lion  THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king.  Hewas neither wrathful cruel nor tyrannical but just and gentleas a king could be.  During his reign he made a royalproclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beastsand drew up conditions for a universal league in which the Wolfand the Lamb the Panther and the Kid the Tiger and the Stagthe Dog and the Hare should live together in perfect peace andamity.  The Hare said Oh how I have longed to see this day inwhich the weak shall take their place with impunity by the sideof the strong.  And after the Hare said this he ran for hislife.   The Wolf and the Crane  A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane for alarge sum to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promisedpayment the Wolf grinning and grinding his teeth exclaimed:Why you have surely already had a sufficient recompense inhaving been permitted to draw out your head in safety from themouth and jaws of a wolf.   In serving the wicked expect no reward and be thankful if youescape injury for your pains.   The Fisherman Piping  A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to theseashore.  Standing on a projecting rock he played several tunesin the hope that the fish attracted by his melody would oftheir own accord dance into his net which he had placed below. At last having long waited in vain he laid aside his flute andcasting his net into the sea made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said:O you most perverse creatures when I piped you would not dancebut now that I have ceased you do so merrily.   Hercules and the Wagoner  A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane when thewheels sank down deep into a rut.  The rustic driver stupefiedand aghast stood looking at the wagon and did nothing but utterloud cries to Hercules to come and help him.  Hercules it issaid appeared and thus addressed him:  Put your shoulders to thewheels my man.  Goad on your bullocks and never more pray to mefor help until you have done your best to help yourself ordepend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.   Self-help is the best help.   The Ants and the Grasshopper  THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collectedin the summertime.  A Grasshopper perishing with famine passedby and earnestly begged for a little food.  The Ants inquired ofhim Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?'  Hereplied I had not leisure enough.  I passed the days insinging.  They then said in derision:  If you were foolish enoughto sing all the summer you must dance supperless to bed in thewinter.   The Traveler and His Dog  A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at thedoor stretching himself.  He asked him sharply:  Why do you standthere gaping? Everything is ready but you so come with meinstantly.  The Dog wagging his tail replied:  O master! I amquite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.   The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.   The Dog and the Shadow  A DOG crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh inhis mouth saw his own shadow in the water and took it for thatof another Dog with a piece of meat double his own in size.  Heimmediately let go of his own and fiercely attacked the otherDog to get his larger piece from him.  He thus lost both:  thatwhich he grasped at in the water because it was a shadow; andhis own because the stream swept it away.   The Mole and His Mother  A MOLE a creature blind from birth once said to his Mother:  Iam sure than I can see Mother!  In the desire to prove to himhis mistake his Mother placed before him a few grains offrankincense and asked What is it?'  The young Mole said Itis a pebble.  His Mother exclaimed:  My son I am afraid that youare not only blind but that you have lost your sense of smell.   The Herdsman and the Lost Bull  A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf fromthe fold.  After a long and fruitless search he made a vow thatif he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf hewould offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes Pan and the GuardianDeities of the forest.  Not long afterwards as he ascended asmall hillock he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight he lifted his eyes and his hands toheaven and said:  Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to theGuardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who hadrobbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief I wouldwillingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost if I mayonly secure my own escape from him in safety.   The Hare and the Tortoise  A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of theTortoise who replied laughing:  Though you be swift as thewind I will beat you in a race.  The Hare believing herassertion to be simply impossible assented to the proposal; andthey agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix thegoal.  On the day appointed for the race the two startedtogether.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped but went onwith a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare lying down by the wayside fell fast asleep.  At lastwaking up and moving as fast as he could he saw the Tortoisehad reached the goal and was comfortably dozing after herfatigue.   Slow but steady wins the race.   The Pomegranate Apple-Tree and Bramble  THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the mostbeautiful.  When their strife was at its height a Bramble fromthe neighboring hedge lifted up its voice and said in a boastfultone:  Pray my dear friends in my presence at least cease fromsuch vain disputings.   The Farmer and the Stork  A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught anumber of Cranes which came to pick up his seed.  With them hetrapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and wasearnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life.  Pray saveme Master he said and let me go free this once.  My brokenlimb should excite your pity.  Besides I am no Crane I am aStork a bird of excellent character; and see how I love andslave for my father and mother.  Look too at my feathers--they are not the least like those of a Crane.   The Farmer laughed aloud and said It may be all as you say I only know this:  I have taken you with these robbers the Cranes and you must die in their company.   Birds of a feather flock together.   The Farmer and the Snake  ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold.  Hehad compassion on it and taking it up placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth and resuming itsnatural instincts bit its benefactor inflicting on him a mortalwound.  Oh cried the Farmer with his last breath I amrightly served for pitying a scoundrel.   The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.   The Fawn and His Mother  A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother You are larger than a dogand swifter and more used to running and you have your horns asa defense; why then O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?She smiled and said:  I know full well my son that all you sayis true.  I have the advantages you mention but when I hear eventhe bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint and fly away asfast as I can.   No arguments will give courage to the coward.   The Bear and the Fox  A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy saying that of allanimals he was the most tender in his regard for man for he hadsuch respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear Oh!that you would eat the dead and not the living.   The Swallow and the Crow  THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying Your feathers areall very well in the spring but mine protect me against thewinter.   Fair weather friends are not worth much.   The Mountain in Labor  A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated.  Loud groans and noiseswere heard and crowds of people came from all parts to see whatwas the matter.  While they were assembled in anxious expectationof some terrible calamity out came a Mouse.   Don't make much ado about nothing.   The Ass the Fox and the Lion  THE ASS and the Fox having entered into partnership together fortheir mutual protection went out into the forest to hunt.  Theyhad not proceeded far when they met a Lion.  The Fox seeingimminent danger approached the Lion and promised to contrive forhim the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word notto harm the Fox.  Then upon assuring the Ass that he would notbe injured the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that heshould fall into it.  The Lion seeing that the Ass was securedimmediately clutched the Fox and attacked the Ass at hisleisure.   The Tortoise and the Eagle  A TORTOISE lazily basking in the sun complained to thesea-birds of her hard fate that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle hovering near heard her lamentation and demanded whatreward she would give him if he would take her aloft and floather in the air.  I will give you she said all the riches ofthe Red Sea.  I will teach you to fly then said the Eagle; andtaking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go and she fell on a lofty mountain dashingher shell to pieces.  The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment ofdeath:  I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to dowith wings and clouds who can with difficulty move about on theearth?'   If men had all they wished they would be often ruined.   The Flies and the Honey-Pot  A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had beenoverturned in a housekeeper's room and placing their feet in itate greedily.  Their feet however became so smeared with thehoney that they could not use their wings nor releasethemselves and were suffocated.  Just as they were expiringthey exclaimed O foolish creatures that we are for the sake ofa little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.   Pleasure bought with pains hurts.   The Man and the Lion  A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest.  They soonbegan to boast of their respective superiority to each other instrength and prowess.  As they were disputing they passed astatue carved in stone which represented a Lion strangled by aMan.  The traveler pointed to it and said:  See there! How strongwe are and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.  TheLion replied:  This statue was made by one of you men.  If weLions knew how to erect statues you would see the Man placedunder the paw of the Lion.   One story is good till another is told.   The Farmer and the Cranes  SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newlysown with wheat.  For a long time the Farmer brandishing anempty sling chased them away by the terror he inspired; but whenthe birds found that the sling was only swung in the air theyceased to take any notice of it and would not move.  The Farmeron seeing this charged his sling with stones and killed a greatnumber.  The remaining birds at once forsook his fields cryingto each other It is time for us to be off to Liliput:  for thisman is no longer content to scare us but begins to show us inearnest what he can do.   If words suffice not blows must follow.   The Dog in the Manger  A DOG lay in a manger and by his growling and snapping preventedthe oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. What a selfish Dog!  said one of them to his companions; hecannot eat the hay himself and yet refuses to allow those to eatwho can.   The Fox and the Goat  A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means ofescape.  A Goat overcome with thirst came to the same well andseeing the Fox inquired if the water was good.  Concealing hissad plight under a merry guise the Fox indulged in a lavishpraise of the water saying it was excellent beyond measure andencouraging him to descend.  The Goat mindful only of histhirst thoughtlessly jumped down but just as he drank the Foxinformed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested ascheme for their common escape.  If said he you will placeyour forefeet upon the wall and bend your head I will run upyour back and escape and will help you out afterwards.  The Goatreadily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadyinghimself with the Goat's horns he safely reached the mouth of thewell and made off as fast as he could.  When the Goat upbraidedhim for breaking his promise he turned around and cried outYou foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your headas you have hairs in your beard you would never have gone downbefore you had inspected the way up nor have exposed yourself todangers from which you had no means of escape.   Look before you leap.   The Bear and the Two Travelers  TWO MEN were traveling together when a Bear suddenly met them ontheir path.  One of them climbed up quickly into a tree andconcealed himself in the branches.  The other seeing that hemust be attacked fell flat on the ground and when the Bear cameup and felt him with his snout and smelt him all over he heldhis breath and feigned the appearance of death as much as hecould.  The Bear soon left him for it is said he will not toucha dead body.  When he was quite gone the other Travelerdescended from the tree and jocularly inquired of his friendwhat it was the Bear had whispered in his ear.  He gave me thisadvice his companion replied.  Never travel with a friend whodeserts you at the approach of danger.   Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.   The Oxen and the Axle-Trees  A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team ofOxen.  The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon theOxen turning round thus addressed the wheels:  Hullo there! whydo you make so much noise? We bear all the labor and we notyou ought to cry out.   Those who suffer most cry out the least.   The Thirsty Pigeon  A PIGEON oppressed by excessive thirst saw a goblet of waterpainted on a signboard.  Not supposing it to be only a pictureshe flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashedagainst the signboard jarring herself terribly.  Having brokenher wings by the blow she fell to the ground and was caught byone of the bystanders.   Zeal should not outrun discretion.   The Raven and the Swan  A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the samebeautiful plumage.  Supposing that the Swan's splendid whitecolor arose from his washing in the water in which he swam theRaven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up hisliving and took up residence in the lakes and pools.  Butcleansing his feathers as often as he would he could not changetheir color while through want of food he perished.   Change of habit cannot alter Nature.   The Goat and the Goatherd  A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid noattention to the summons.  At last the Goatherd threw a stoneand breaking its horn begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied Why you silly fellow the horn will speakthough I be silent.   Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.   The Miser  A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold which heburied in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall andwent to look at daily.  One of his workmen observed his frequentvisits to the spot and decided to watch his movements.  He soondiscovered the secret of the hidden treasure and digging downcame to the lump of gold and stole it.  The Miser on his nextvisit found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and tomake loud lamentations.  A neighbor seeing him overcome withgrief and learning the cause said Pray do not grieve so; butgo and take a stone and place it in the hole and fancy that thegold is still lying there.  It will do you quite the sameservice; for when the gold was there you had it not as you didnot make the slightest use of it.   The Sick Lion  A LION unable from old age and infirmities to provide himselfwith food by force resolved to do so by artifice.  He returnedto his den and lying down there pretended to be sick takingcare that his sickness should be publicly known.  The beastsexpressed their sorrow and came one by one to his den where theLion devoured them.  After many of the beasts had thusdisappeared the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himselfto the Lion stood on the outside of the cave at a respectfuldistance and asked him how he was.  I am very middlingreplied the Lion but why do you stand without? Pray enterwithin to talk with me.  No thank you said the Fox.  Inotice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave butI see no trace of any returning.   He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.   The Horse and Groom  A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing downhis Horse but at the same time stole his oats and sold them forhis own profit.  Alas!  said the Horse if you really wish meto be in good condition you should groom me less and feed memore.   The Ass and the Lapdog  A MAN had an Ass and a Maltese Lapdog a very great beauty.  TheAss was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eatjust as any other Ass would.  The Lapdog knew many tricks and wasa great favorite with his master who often fondled him andseldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit toeat.  The Ass on the contrary had much work to do in grindingthe corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdensfrom the farm.  He often lamented his own hard fate andcontrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog till atlast one day he broke his cords and halter and galloped into hismaster's house kicking up his heels without measure andfrisking and fawning as well as he could.  He next tried to jumpabout his master as he had seen the Lapdog do but he broke thetable and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.  He thenattempted to lick his master and jumped upon his back.  Theservants hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger oftheir master quickly relieved him and drove out the Ass to his" ;
